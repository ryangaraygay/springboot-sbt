# springboot-sbt
example/demo springboot project using sbt (simple build tool)

* used spring initializer to get started with an application (web, actuator, jpa - though only used web so far) - http://start.spring.io/
there is only Maven/Gradle projects and will use sbt so just chose Maven
* unzip the zip file generated from the initializer (resulting in demo folder)
